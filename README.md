# Browser Extension Projects

This repository contains browser extension utilities and supporting code developed by me.

I build privacy-first Chrome extensions focused on:
- Productivity
- Media utilities
- Commerce-related tools

Some projects are published on the Chrome Web Store, while others are experimental or under development.

Monetization (where applicable) is transparent and user-initiated, such as affiliate links or subscriptions, in compliance with platform policies.

This repository is provided for demonstration and review purposes.
